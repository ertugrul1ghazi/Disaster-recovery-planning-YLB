# Disaster-recovery-planning-YLB
YLB bank, is a very big business, that may face different types of threats, for example, Cyber-attacks (phishing scams, ransomware, MITM…), Natural Disasters (earthquake, flood, fire…), Political instability (force closing due to a disease ) , Economic Instability (Failure of the country coin value in the market ), Human Error (an employee deletes data ),Supply chain disruption (supply chain impacted by a natural disaster ) and etc.. These threats must be measured even by quantitative or qualitative methodologies according the threat type. The YLB must use risk mitigation strategies, limitation , avoidance and transfer , accepting a risk is not a solution . Moreover, it must implement several services and ideas to limit/reduce or avoid the exposure to the risk, or it can transfer the impact into another assurance company that pay to the losses that might happen. A company like this has several key functions, Marketing (Developing marketing campaigns, Conducting Market Research …), Financial (Financial Reporting and analysis, Risk Management), Disaster Recovery (Site Failover; Switching to the backup) , Data Storage (Data-Replication: Real-time Synchronisation , Data-Backup: Creating copies of data and storing them in separate locations ) , Customer Service (Handling customer inquiries and complaints, 
Developing customer loyalty programs), and too many other key functions and processes, all these must have RPO, RTO, WRT, MTD. To keep the operations ongoing and functioning well.
